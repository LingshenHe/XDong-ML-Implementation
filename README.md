# XDong_ML_Implementation

#####This is my implementation of ML based on Tensorflow and Keras(I am also author of Chinese manual of Keras, please enjoy it http://keras-cn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

#####This repository mainly includes reproducing of prior work and experience of my own idea. I will only release them after running on my own PC successful. As a result, if you have problem with running, please check your running environment. 
######You can also contact with me [N1503521A@e.ntu.edu.cn] if you have any suggestion and problem.

Please note: you can use these codes freely, but please remember to cite the origin paper. Having fun.
